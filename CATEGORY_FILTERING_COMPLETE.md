# ✅ Category-Based Filtering - Complete Implementation

## 🎯 **What's Been Implemented**

I've implemented **strict category-based filtering** so that each website page shows **ONLY** posts from its specific category.

---

## 🔒 **Category Isolation**

### How It Works:

Each website page now has a **fixed category filter**:

| Website Page | Category Filter | What It Shows |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| `/school-news` | **School News** ONLY | Posts with category = "School News" |
| `/past-events` | **Past Events** ONLY | Posts with category = "Past Events" |
| `/latest-news` | **Latest News** ONLY | Posts with category = "Latest News" |
| `/latest-buzz` | ALL categories | Shows all published posts |

---

## ✅ **Code Implementation**

### Example: School News Page

```typescript
const CATEGORY_NAME = 'School News'; // Fixed category

useEffect(() => {
  // Load ONLY published posts from "School News" category
  const loadedPosts = getPosts().filter(
    (post) => post.status === 'published' && post.category === CATEGORY_NAME
  );
  setPosts(loadedPosts);
}, []);
```

### Key Points:
✅ **Fixed category** constant per page  
✅ **Double filter**: `status === 'published'` AND `category === CATEGORY_NAME`  
✅ **No category dropdown** on website pages  
✅ **Strict isolation** - no cross-category display  

---

## 📊 **Dashboard Integration**

### Dashboard Pages:
Each dashboard page **auto-assigns** its category:

| Dashboard Page | Auto-Assigned Category | Color Theme |
|---------------|----------------------|-------------|
| `/dashboard/school-news` | "School News" | 🟢 Green |
| `/dashboard/past-events` | "Past Events" | 🟣 Purple |
| `/dashboard/latest-news` | "Latest News" | 🔵 Blue |

---

## 🔄 **Complete Workflow**

### Creating Posts:

1. **Dashboard → School News → Create Post**
   - Category auto-set to "School News"
   - Publish when ready
   - ✅ Appears ONLY on `/school-news`

2. **Dashboard → Past Events → Create Post**
   - Category auto-set to "Past Events"
   - Publish when ready
   - ✅ Appears ONLY on `/past-events`

3. **Dashboard → Latest News → Create Post**
   - Category auto-set to "Latest News"
   - Publish when ready
   - ✅ Appears ONLY on `/latest-news`

### Viewing Posts:

**On Website:**
- `/school-news` → See ONLY "School News" posts
- `/past-events` → See ONLY "Past Events" posts
- `/latest-news` → See ONLY "Latest News" posts
- `/latest-buzz` → See ALL published posts (mixed)

**Isolation Guarantee:**
- School News posts will NEVER appear in Past Events
- Past Events posts will NEVER appear in Latest News
- Latest News posts will NEVER appear in School News

---

## ✅ **Verification**

### Test Scenario:

1. **Create 3 posts in different categories:**
   - Post A in School News
   - Post B in Past Events
   - Post C in Latest News

2. **Check website pages:**
   - `/school-news` → Shows ONLY Post A ✅
   - `/past-events` → Shows ONLY Post B ✅
   - `/latest-news` → Shows ONLY Post C ✅
   - `/latest-buzz` → Shows A, B, and C ✅

## 🎨 **Visual Differences**

### School News (`/school-news`):
- Hero: Green → Teal gradient
- Search bar: Green focus ring
- Category badge: Green background
- "School News" in title

### Past Events (`/past-events`):
- Hero: Purple → Pink gradient
- Search bar: Purple focus ring
- Category badge: Purple background
- "Past Events" in title

### Latest News (`/latest-news`):
- Hero: Blue → Purple gradient
- Search bar: Blue focus ring
- Category badge: Blue background
- "Latest News" in title

---

## 📝 **Search Functionality**

Each page has its own search that searches **ONLY within its category**:

- **School News** search → Searches School News posts only
- **Past Events** search → Searches Past Events posts only
- **Latest News** search → Searches Latest News posts only

---

## 🔐 **Category Assignment Protection**

### In Dashboard:
- Each category page **hardcodes** the category
- Users cannot change the category
- Auto-assigned on post creation

```typescript
const newPost: Post = {
  ...
  category: CATEGORY, // Hardcoded category
  ...
};
```

### Benefits:
✅ No accidental mis-categorization  
✅ Consistent category assignment  
✅ Simplified UI (no dropdown needed)  
✅ Clear separation of content

## 📊 **Data Flow**

```
Dashboard Side:
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ School News Page        │
│ Category: "School News" │ → LocalStorage → Post with category="School News"
└─────────────────────────┘

Website Side:
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ /school-news Page       │
│ Filter: "School News"   │ → Shows ONLY "School News" posts
└─────────────────────────┘
```
