## 🔄 Real-Time Updates

### How Updates Work

**When you create/edit in admin:**
1. Data saved to localStorage immediately
2. Navigate to public page
3. Page loads fresh data from localStorage
4. Content appears instantly

**Note**: If public page is already open, refresh to see updates.

## 📊 Data Persistence

### Storage Keys
```javascript
admin_events       // All events
admin_posts        // All posts/blogs
admin_categories   // All categories
admin_media        // All uploaded media
admin_auth_token   // Login session
admin_user_data    // User info
```

### Data Retention
- Data persists in browser localStorage
- Survives page refreshes
- Cleared only when:
  - You clear browser data
  - You click "Clear All Data" in Settings
  - You manually clear localStorage
